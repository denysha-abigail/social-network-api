- To install this application, clone this repository onto your local computer, open it in your preferred code editor (i.e. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), and run the command ```npm i``` on your terminal.

## Usage
- Once all dependencies have been installed, run the command ```npm start``` to turn on your server.
