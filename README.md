## Installation
- Prior to starting up the program, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb), and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) installed onto your local computer for optimal user experience.

- To install this application, clone this repository onto your local computer, open it in your preferred code editor (i.e. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)), and run the command ```npm i``` on your terminal.

## Usage
- Once all dependencies have been installed, run the command ```npm start``` to turn on your server.

- Once the server has been turned on, head over to Insomnia to test the API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in order to create, read, update, and delete data in the social network database.  

- Please note that in order to properly test all routes, at least one user must first be created.
